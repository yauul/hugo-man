## üëäüèæ What it do!

### The Issue

Nowadays, companies typically require intermediate to advanced levels of experience for most jobs. Fresh graduates in the IT industry often face challenges finding jobs due to a lack of skills and mentorship.

These and other challenges can be disheartening for fresh graduates. I have personally experienced this and I'm sure some of you have as well, in IT or your respective fields. But don't worry.

### Goal

I cannot change the requirements of IT companies. I can, however, help you get that advantage that you need to separate yourself from the rest ‚Äî that edge you need to help you get started in IT. 

I made this website so that I can share my experience with all of you and hopefully help you become a better IT professional.

### A Little About Me

I'm an IT guy with experience in a lot IT domains. 

I have experience in network administration, Linux, and web application development. Although these may seem like different IT domains, they have definitely helped me solve real-world problems where others couldn't.
